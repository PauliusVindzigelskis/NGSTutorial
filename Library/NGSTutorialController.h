/**
 Mechanism to show tutorial guidelines on screen by providing points of interest with texts nearby.
 
 ## How it works
 
 Scene consists of collection of NGSItem objects passed by dataSource. Tutorial can have 1 or more Scenes (section in NSIndexPath) which navigation can be controlled by loadScene: (or its equivalent) method.
 
 By default, each user tap navigates to next scene (closes tutorial on last), but this can be overriden with tutorialControllerDidReceiveTap: delegate method.
